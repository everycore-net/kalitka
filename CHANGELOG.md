# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Trusted proxies.** `TrustedProxies` (CIDR list) decides whether forwarded
  headers are believed at all. Requests that did not arrive from one of these
  are judged on the address the connection actually came from.
- **Rate limiting.** A sliding window per address (`MaxRequestsPerIp`,
  `RateWindowMinutes`) and a ceiling on requests waiting for an answer
  (`MaxPending`). Over the limit the door stays silent — the same answer a
  blocked caller gets, so there is nothing to learn from it.
- **Host-scoped sessions.** `CookieScope=Host` is now the default: an approved
  visitor carries a short-lived, single-use token to the target, and the auth
  check there turns it into a cookie for that host alone. Neighbours under the
  same parent domain never receive it. `CookieScope=ParentDomain` keeps the old
  one-cookie-for-everything behaviour as an explicit choice.
- **Audit log.** One structured line per decision: request id, host, client
  address, identity, admin and reason. Secrets, tokens and cookie values are
  never logged.
- **`/allow` and `/block`.** Fill either list before anyone rings, instead of
  only being able to react to a request.

### Changed

- **`X-Forwarded-For` is read from the right**, past known proxies, instead of
  taking the leftmost entry. A proxy only ever appends on the right; everything
  to the left is whatever the caller wrote. Reading it the obvious way let a
  visitor choose their own address — and with it their own place on the allow
  list.
- **Redirect targets must be a currently guarded host**, not merely a name under
  the same domain. A forged `Host` header could otherwise steer visitors to a
  name that was never guarded.
- **Telegram callbacks expire.** A decision was already terminal after the first
  press; now the request also has to still be within its lifetime, so an old
  button cannot resurrect one.

### Security

- Startup refuses `BypassNetworks` without `TrustedProxies`. Behind a proxy every
  visitor would otherwise appear to come from the proxy, and a bypass range
  containing that address would wave everyone through while the configuration
  looked entirely correct.

### Upgrading

`CookieScope=Host` needs the proxy to pass `Set-Cookie` back from the auth
request. For Traefik:

```yaml
http:
  middlewares:
    kalitka:
      forwardAuth:
        address: "http://kalitka:8080/auth"
        trustForwardHeader: false
        authResponseHeaders:
          - "Set-Cookie"
```

Without it a visitor is approved, receives no cookie and loops back to the gate.
Set `CookieScope=ParentDomain` if you would rather keep the previous behaviour.

Set `TrustedProxies` to the range your reverse proxy connects from. For Docker:

```
docker network inspect proxy -f '{{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Subnet}}'
```
